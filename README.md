# Pascal's Triangle

This script was written in the course Logic and Maths for Computing/Computer science.
The task was to generate and print a pascal's triangle. This script prettyprints it :)

I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)

### Run the script
The script is interactive and will ask runtime questions.
```python
$ python triangle.py
```
